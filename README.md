Online Bookstore


Develop online Bookstore application to serve between the Front and Back-end sides: displaying a list of books 
via paging bar; allowing add/remove books to/from user wishlist and only in-stock books to/from shopcart, submitting 
order form and authenticating user sign-in/sign-up, using JavaScript, T-SQL, JDBC, JSP, JavaBeans, Servlet, Filter 
and JSTL in Eclipse.
